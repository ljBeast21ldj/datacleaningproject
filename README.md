# In this project, I performed a thorough data cleaning on the US household incomes and US household statistics datasets to prepare them for analysis. 
This included: 
* removing duplicate records,
* correcting spelling errors,
* and eliminating blank entries.

I also handled NULL values by either imputing appropriate replacements or removing incomplete rows where necessary. These steps ensured the datasets were accurate, consistent, and ready for meaningful analysis.
